# Flights_Manipulation 
## Tidying and Transforming Data
![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76123653/110219335-8a8dc480-7e8c-11eb-86cf-8781f4c8974a.PNG)

-(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

		Los Angeles	Phoenix	San Diego	San Francisco	Seattle
ALASKA	on time	497	221	212	503	1841
ALASKA	delayed	62	12	20	102	305
AM WEST	on time	694	4840	383	320	201
AM WEST	delayed	117	415	65	129	61

-(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
and transform your data.

-(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

-(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
homework submission:

 The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
 The URL for your rpubs.com web page.
