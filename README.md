# Flights_Manipulation 
## Tidying and Transforming Data
![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76123653/110219335-8a8dc480-7e8c-11eb-86cf-8781f4c8974a.PNG)

-(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

			Los Angeles	Phoenix		San Diego	San Francisco	Seattle
	ALASKA	on time	 	497	221			212		503	1841
	ALASKA	delayed		62	12			20		102	305
	AM WEST	on time		694	4840			383		320	201
	AM WEST	delayed		117	415			65		129	61

-(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
and transform your data.

-(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

-(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
homework submission:

 The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
 The URL for your rpubs.com web page.
