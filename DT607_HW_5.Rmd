## Tidying Tables

## Challenge{.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Overview 

 **Challenge**

**The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:**

![](images/Example.PNG)

(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your homework submission:

- The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
- The URL for your rpubs.com web page.




### Packages

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Packages used

library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(stringr)

```

### Dataset 
#### {.tabset}
##### Flights

Notice that because we used read_csv(), the data frame we received now prints nicely without having to use the head() function and does not clutter your screen.

```{r}

flights <-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgino11/Flights_Mani/main/HW_5_flights.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

glimpse(flights)

```

We need to get rid of spaces in "on time" so we can later manipulate data

```{r}
flights[,2] <- sapply(flights[,2], str_replace, " ", "_")
flights
```

#### {-}

### Manipulate

**Clean data**
Add the header Airline and Arrival Status to column 1 and 2.
Pivot Longer for Arrival City 


```{r, message=FALSE}
flights_pivot_1 <-flights %>%
  rename(airline = X, arrival.status = X.1) %>%
   pivot_longer(flights,
    cols = c(Los.Angeles, Phoenix, San.Diego, San.Francisco, Seattle),
    names_to = "Arrival_City",
    values_to = "Flight"
    )

flights_pivot_1
```

**Pivot Wider**
I want to know the airline the Arrival City and what flight is on time or delayed

```{r}
flights_pivot_1 <- flights_pivot_1 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = arrival.status, 
              values_from = Flight)

flights_pivot_1

```


#### Transform
**I want to know the total  number of flights and the average delay**
```{r}
flights_pivot_1 <- flights_pivot_1 %>%
  mutate(total_flights = on_time + delayed, 
         delayed_avg =   round((delayed/total_flights)*100,2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(delayed_avg))

flights_pivot_1

```

### Graphs
##### {.tabset}
#### Delayed Avg by Airline

I want to interpret graphically the frequency of delayed flights by airline

```{r}
ggplot(flights_pivot_1, aes(x = airline, y = delayed_avg,)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + ggtitle("Delayed Rate by Airline")

```


#### Delayed Avg by City

I want to interpret graphically the frequency of delayed flights by City

```{r}
ggplot(flights_pivot_1, aes(x = Arrival_City, y = delayed_avg)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + ggtitle("Delayed Rate by City")

```

##### {-}

### Conclusion
#### Delays By Airline
Thanks to the data Wrangling we were able to determine that AM West has more delays compared to Alaska Airlines

```{r}
ggplot(flights_pivot_1, aes(x = airline, y = delayed_avg,)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + ggtitle("Delayed Rate by Airline")
```


#### Delays By city

Thanks to the data wrangling I was able to determine that SFO and SEATTLE are the two cities with the most delays on average for the two airlines considered in this data Set.

```{r}
ggplot(flights_pivot_1, aes(x = Arrival_City, y = delayed_avg)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + ggtitle("Delayed Rate by City")
```
